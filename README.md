# Heart Failure Predictions
* Author: Shelly-Ann Duncan
# Business Problem
* The purpose of this projest is to predict heart disease in persons, male and female.
# Data Source and Information
* The source for this data can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction. This dataset is comprised of 12 columns, (11 features and 1 target) and 918 rows representing the characteristics of Heart Disease.
